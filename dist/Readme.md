  ## Description
  A command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md based off user input. The user will be prompted with a series of questions to help generate the README.md file afterwards. The README will display a title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions. A badge for the selected license will also be generated with the README which will also redirect to the license's webpage.
